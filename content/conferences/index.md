title: "Conferences with Reproducibility"

The Conferences with Reproducibility is intended as a community-maintained resource that lists all computer science conferences that have an initiative related to reproducibility, especially awards recognizing reproducibility artifacts. The conferences are listed in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UsR0ZrL4OiQ-aVJSii2XzLybE-OYg5HOaPWTvhfAhd4/edit?usp=sharing) using a new tab for each calendar year.

If you find that a particular conference is not listed, please consider updating the Google Sheet (you should have write access). 

Every recipient of the reproducibility awards is likely an example of practice that advances the state of the art of practical reproducibility. Please help making these examples known to the ACM REP community.
